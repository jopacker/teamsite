		  <p>These are the terms and conditions for those people who are volunteering for inclusion in University of Cambridge Design Team Volunteer Database.
          <h3>Data Protection</h3>
          <p>Information about you is collected and used by the University of Cambridge Design Team for the purpose of providing you with relevant information and advice about opportunities to volunteer to be part of our studies. Records are securely held and only available to you, our research staff, research partners (such as members of other University departments or institutions), and our system administrators. Members of other departments will not be able to access information in the Volunteer Database once they have finished collaborations with the University of Cambridge Design Team. All information you provide for this database is confidential and will not be disclosed to anyone other than those mentioned above without your express consent.
</p>
          <h3>Additional Information</h3>
          <p>By volunteering on this website, you are agreeing to allow University of Cambridge Design Team to hold your personal details on a secured database, and you are agreeing to be contacted with details about current and future research studies. Until you remove your details from the database, or request that your details be removed, your details will remain available on our database. You can ask for your details to be removed at any time. If you are contacted about a study that you do not wish to participate in, then you may always choose not to participate in that study, but you can still be contacted in the future about other studies, unless you ask for your details to be removed from the database.
